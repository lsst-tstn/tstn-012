# Abstract, if available
abstract: >
  This document describes the procedure used to measure the look-up
  table for the Auxiliary Telescope primary mirror support pressure
  as a function of elevation. We start with a description of the
  support system and the software used to control it. The data
  acquisition process is described along with the fit to the data
  and loading the results into the active optics system.
